<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>Degree<br> Major: Bachelors of Science in Computer Science<br> Minor: Mathematics<br><br> 
    College: University of Massachusetts Lowell<br> 
    High School: Lowell Catholic High School<br>
    Fraternity: Sigma Tau Gamma</p>

<h3>Principles I live By</h3>

<p>Be Authentic / Be Myself... because it takes more energy to act differently than I naturally am.<br>
    Focus on the value that I can give to others rather than what others can give to me.<br>
    Be kind in any situation because what good does being mean to someone do?</p>
